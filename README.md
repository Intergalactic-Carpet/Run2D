# Run2D
Run2D is a basic game I made, the objective is to continue without stopping, stopping for too long will result in your death
It has a range of difficulties, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Impossible. The names should represent how playable it is.

# How to play Run2D
Just double click the .exe file (Run2D.exe)
Or, if you dont trust it, run the following script in terminal to create your own .exe file

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --name=Run2D --onefile main.py

Note: You will need to have pip installed, or use a different installer to install pyinstaller

# Usage
Feel free to use my code anywhere you like, however could you credit me if you do so
